# Workshop Topic and Content
Accessibility of research data is critical for advances in many research fields but textual data often cannot be shared due to the personal and sensitive information which it contains, e.g names, political opinions, sensitive personal information and medical data. General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR (EU Commission, 2016), suggests pseudonymization as a solution to secure open access to research data but we need to learn more about pseudonymization as an approach before adopting it for manipulation of research data (Volodina et al., 2023). The main challenge is how to effectively pseudonymize data so that such individuals cannot be identified but at the same time the data is still usable for the natural language processing tasks for which it was collected and for other types of research.
This workshop invites a broad community of researchers in all concerned cross-disciplinary fields to jointly discuss challenges within pseudonymization, such as

* automatic approaches to _detection and labelling_ of personal information in unstructured language data, including events and other context-dependent cues revealing a person;
* developing context-sensitive algorithms for _replacement_ of personal information in unstructured data;
* studies into the _effects_ of pseudonymization on unstructured data, e.g. applicability of pseudonymised data for the intended research questions, readability of pseudonymised data or addition of unwelcome biases through pseudonymization;
* _effectiveness_ of pseudonymization as a way of protecting writer identity;
* _reidentification_ studies;
* constructing datasets for automatic pseudonymization, including _methodological and ethical aspects_ of those;
* approaches to the _evaluation_ of automatic pseudonymization both in concealing the private information and preserving the semantics of the non-personal data;
* and numerous other open questions.
