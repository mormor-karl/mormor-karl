<!--SVALA - pseudonymizer-->

<!-- (from Bea's decrypt page) We provide tools for transcription and decipherment of historical ciphers using advanced machine learning algorithms. Historical cipher images can be transcribed, i.e. transformed into a computer readable text format with the help of the TranscriptTool. The transcribed ciphertext can be corrected and used as input to CrypTool which assists you in breaking a wide range of historical ciphertexts.  -->

<!-- We have released several datasets, tools, and documents as part Mormor Karl project. Here you can find them:-->
