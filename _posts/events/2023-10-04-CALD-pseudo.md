## Workshop Topic and Content
Accessibility of research data is critical for advances in many research fields but textual data often cannot be shared due to the personal and sensitive information which it contains, e.g names, political opinions, sensitive personal information and medical data. General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR (EU Commission, 2016), suggests pseudonymization as a solution to secure open access to research data but we need to learn more about pseudonymization as an approach before adopting it for manipulation of research data (Volodina et al., 2023). The main challenge is how to effectively pseudonymize data so that such individuals cannot be identified, while at the same time keeping the data usable for research (e.g. in computational linguistics, linguistics) and natural language processing tasks for which it was collected.
This workshop invites a broad community of researchers in all concerned cross-disciplinary fields to jointly discuss challenges within pseudonymization, such as

* automatic approaches to _detection and labelling_ of personal information in unstructured language data, including events and other context-dependent cues revealing a person;
* developing context-sensitive algorithms for _replacement_ of personal information in unstructured data;
* studies into the _effects_ of pseudonymization on unstructured data, e.g. applicability of pseudonymised data for the intended research questions, readability of pseudonymised data or addition of unwelcome biases through pseudonymization;
* _effectiveness_ of pseudonymization as a way of protecting writer identity;
* _reidentification_ studies;
* constructing datasets for automatic pseudonymization, including _methodological and ethical aspects_ of those;
* approaches to the _evaluation_ of automatic pseudonymization both in concealing the private information and preserving the semantics of the non-personal data;
* and numerous other open questions.

## Submission information

We will be using the [ACL templates](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) for the workshop (you will find LaTeX and Word templates here). Please, make sure that your submissions take into consideration the following [ACLPUB instructions](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html#style-files). Submissions that do not adhere to the ACLPUB guidelines will be rejected without review.

<!-- 
**IMPORTANT**: For licensing reasons, all camera-ready papers must include the following sentence as an unmarked (unnumbered) footnote on the first page of the paper: This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/. NEW: Please note that the footnote will automatically be added to the final version for the LaTeX template (and Overleaf template once approved).

The footnote can be added by adding the following piece of code before the abstract: $\let\thefootnote\relax\footnotetext{This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.} $
-->

Authors are invited to submit _long papers_ (8 pages) alternatively _short_ or _demo_ papers (4 pages), page count not including references. Please indicate one relevant paper type at submission time. Only pdf files will be accepted. Submissions will be managed through the electronic conference management system [https://softconf.com/eacl2024/CALD-pseudo-2024/](https://softconf.com/eacl2024/CALD-pseudo-2024/). Final camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments.

------

## Make a submission

Papers should describe original unpublished work or work-in-progress. Every paper will be reviewed by at least 2 members of the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, significance and impact of ideas or results.

All accepted papers will be collected into a proceedings volume to be submitted for publication in the EACL volume.

### Ildikó Pilán, the Norwegian Computing Center, Norway

**Title** TBA

**Ildikó Pilán** has a PhD in computational linguistics and is a Senior Research Scientist from the Norwegian Computing Center, Norway. Her most impactful research comes from linguistic complexity studies within the domain of language learning, and recently from the area of anonymization and pseudonymization where she has been actively working on preparing datasets, benchmarks and models for automatic anonymization and pseudonymization of Norwegian and English data in the project Cleanup (e.g. Lison et al., 2021; Pilán et al., 2022). The fields her expertise is immediately concerned with are Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, privacy protection, data privacy, Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning.
