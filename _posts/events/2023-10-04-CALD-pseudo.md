## Call for papers

[--|
|We invite submissions to the first edition of the CALD-pseudo workshop on **C**omputational **A**pproaches to **L**anguage **D**ata **Pseudo**nymization, to be held at EACL 2024 on March 21 or 22, 2024.|

| Description |
|--|
|Accessibility of research data is critical for advances in many research fields but textual data often cannot be shared due to the personal and sensitive information which it contains, e.g names, political opinions, sensitive personal information and medical data. General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR (EU Commission, 2016), suggests pseudonymization as a solution to secure open access to research data but we need to learn more about pseudonymization as an approach before adopting it for manipulation of research data (Volodina et al., 2023). The main challenge is how to effectively pseudonymize data so that such individuals cannot be identified, while at the same time keeping the data usable for research (e.g. in computational linguistics, linguistics) and natural language processing tasks for which it was collected.|

|Topics of interest |
|--|
|This workshop invites a broad community of researchers in all concerned cross-disciplinary fields to jointly discuss challenges within pseudonymization, such as|
|* automatic approaches to _detection and labelling_ of personal information in unstructured language data, including events and other context-dependent cues revealing a person;|
|* developing context-sensitive algorithms for _replacement_ of personal information in unstructured data;|
|* studies into the _effects_ of pseudonymization on unstructured data, e.g. applicability of pseudonymised data for the intended research questions, readability of pseudonymised data or addition of unwelcome biases through pseudonymization; |
|* _effectiveness_ of pseudonymization as a way of protecting writer identity;|
|* _reidentification_ studies, e.g. adversarial learning techniques that attempt to breach the privacy protections of pseudonymized data; |
|* constructing datasets for automatic pseudonymization, including _methodological and ethical aspects_ of those;|
|* approaches to the _evaluation_ of automatic pseudonymization both in concealing the private information and preserving the semantics of the non-personal data;|
|* pseudonymization tools and software: evaluating the available tools and software for pseudonymization in different languages, and their ease of use, scalability, and performance;|
|* and numerous other open questions.|

## Submission information

|  |
|--|
|Authors are invited to submit by December 18, 2023 original and unpublished research papers in the following categories: <br><br> * Full papers (up to 8 pages) for substantial contributions <br> * Short or demo papers (up to 4 pages) for ongoing or preliminary work <br><br> All submissions must be in PDF format must follow the EACL 2024 guidelines described in the ARR CfP [https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp), be in pdf, and use the official ACL style templates available here: [https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) <br><br> * Direct submission deadline: December 18, 2023 at [https://softconf.com/eacl2024/CALD-pseudo-2024/](https://softconf.com/eacl2024/CALD-pseudo-2024/) <br> * Deadline for registration of ARR reviewed papers: January 17, 2023. (Further instructions will follow.) <br><br>
We also invite authors of papers on the topics of the workshop accepted to Findings to reach out to the organizing committee of CALD-pseudo to present them at the workshop. <br> Every paper will be reviewed by at least 2 members of the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, significance and impact of ideas or results.
<br> Final camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments.|

|**BIO** <br> Ildikó Pilán is a Senior Research Scientist at the Norwegian Computing Center, Norway. Her most impactful research comes from linguistic complexity studies within the domain of language learning, and recently from the area of anonymization and pseudonymization where she has been actively working on preparing datasets, benchmarks and models for automatic anonymization and pseudonymization of Norwegian and English data in the project Cleanup (e.g. Lison et al., 2021; Pilán et al., 2022). Her fields of expertise include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, privacy protection, data privacy, medical text processing and Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning.|
