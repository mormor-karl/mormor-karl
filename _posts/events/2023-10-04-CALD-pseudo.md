| Anders Søgaard, University of Copenhagen, Denmark|

|**NLP is Dead - Now What?** <br> For decades, the NLP community was on a mission to get computers to understand language. To the extent the goal of the mission was defined, our mission is complete. Now what? There’s still a ton of open problems, of course. Pseudonymization is one of them. Others include bias mitigation, performance parity, or getting things to run on-device. None of these problems are NLP problems, but they are all inter-dependent. Does their locus leave room for a raison d'être for the remnants of NLP?|
| **BIO** <br> Anders Søgaard is Full Professor in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, Dpt. of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen. He is also affiliated with the Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence, Dpt. of Philosophy, and Center for Social Data Science. He was previously at University of Potsdam, Amazon and Google Research. He has won eight best paper awards and several prestigious grants|

|**Pseudonymisation and related techniques: a quest for determining what personal information to rewrite and how** <br>In this talk, we will walk through the different steps involved in the process of concealing personal information. We will start by looking at methods for which pieces of personal information to detect and how. We will then discuss strategies for rewriting these and, finally, we will look at approaches proposed for evaluating the resulting redacted text in terms of privacy protection and utility preservation. We will discuss previous work inspired by Named Entity Recognition as well as more recent approaches employing Large Language Models. We will also explore the differences between pseudonymization and anonymization highlighting the remaining challenges in performing these automatically.|
|**BIO** <br> Ildikó Pilán is a Senior Research Scientist at the Norwegian Computing Center, Norway. Her most impactful research comes from linguistic complexity studies within the domain of language learning, and recently from the area of anonymization and pseudonymization where she has been actively working on preparing datasets, benchmarks and models for automatic anonymization and pseudonymization of Norwegian and English data in the project Cleanup (e.g. Lison et al., 2021; Pilán et al., 2022). Her fields of expertise include Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, privacy protection, data privacy, medical text processing and Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning.|

## Call for papers

|  |
|--|
|We invite submissions to the first edition of the CALD-pseudo workshop on **C**omputational **A**pproaches to **L**anguage **D**ata **Pseudo**nymization, to be held at EACL 2024 on March 21, 2024.|

| Description |
|--|
|Accessibility of research data is critical for advances in many research fields but textual data often cannot be shared due to the personal and sensitive information which it contains, e.g names, political opinions, sensitive personal information and medical data. General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR (EU Commission, 2016), suggests pseudonymization as a solution to secure open access to research data but we need to learn more about pseudonymization as an approach before adopting it for manipulation of research data (Volodina et al., 2023). The main challenge is how to effectively pseudonymize data so that such individuals cannot be identified, while at the same time keeping the data usable for research (e.g. in computational linguistics, linguistics) and natural language processing tasks for which it was collected.|

|Topics of interest |
|--|
|This workshop invites a broad community of researchers in all concerned cross-disciplinary fields to jointly discuss challenges within pseudonymization, such as|
|* automatic approaches to _detection and labelling_ of personal information in unstructured language data, including events and other context-dependent cues revealing a person;|
|* developing context-sensitive algorithms for _replacement_ of personal information in unstructured data;|
|* studies into the _effects_ of pseudonymization on unstructured data, e.g. applicability of pseudonymised data for the intended research questions, readability of pseudonymised data or addition of unwelcome biases through pseudonymization; |
|* _effectiveness_ of pseudonymization as a way of protecting writer identity;|
|* _reidentification_ studies, e.g. adversarial learning techniques that attempt to breach the privacy protections of pseudonymized data; |
|* constructing datasets for automatic pseudonymization, including _methodological and ethical aspects_ of those;|
|* approaches to the _evaluation_ of automatic pseudonymization both in concealing the private information and preserving the semantics of the non-personal data;|
|* pseudonymization _tools and software_: evaluating the available tools and software for pseudonymization in different languages, and their ease of use, scalability, and performance;|
|* and numerous other open questions.|

|Authors are invited to submit by December 18, 2023 original and unpublished research papers in the following categories: <br><br> __Full papers__ (up to 8 pages) for substantial contributions <br> __Short__ or __demo papers__ (up to 4 pages) for ongoing or preliminary work <br><br> All submissions must be in PDF format must follow the EACL 2024 guidelines described in the ARR CfP [https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp), be in pdf, and use the official ACL style templates available here: [https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) <br><br> __Direct submission deadline__: December 18, 2023 at [https://softconf.com/eacl2024/CALD-pseudo-2024/](https://softconf.com/eacl2024/CALD-pseudo-2024/) <br> __Deadline for registration of ARR reviewed papers__: January 19, 2023. <br>Use ARR commitment link: [https://openreview.net/group?id=eacl.org/EACL/2024/Workshop/CALD_pseudo_ARR_Commitment](https://openreview.net/group?id=eacl.org/EACL/2024/Workshop/CALD_pseudo_ARR_Commitment) <br><br> We also invite authors of papers on the topics of the workshop accepted to Findings to reach out to the organizing committee of CALD-pseudo to present them at the workshop. <br> Every paper will be reviewed by at least 2 members of the program committee. As reviewing will be blind, please ensure that papers are anonymous. Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Submissions will be judged on appropriateness, clarity, originality/innovativeness, correctness/soundness, meaningful comparison, significance and impact of ideas or results.
<br> Final camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments.|
