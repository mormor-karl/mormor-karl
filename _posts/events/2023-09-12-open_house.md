# Open House at Grandma Karl's

[Grandma Karl](https://mormor-karl.github.io/) is a project on pseudonymization of research data funded by the Swedish Research Council

**Call for participation**

Accessibility of research data is critical for advances in many research fields but textual data often cannot be shared due to the personal and sensitive information which it contains, e.g names, political opinions, sensitive personal information and medical data. General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR (EU Commission, 2016), suggests pseudonymization as a solution to secure open access to research data but we need to learn more about pseudonymization as an approach before adopting it for manipulation of research data (Volodina et al., 2023). The main challenge is how to effectively pseudonymize data so that such individuals cannot be identified but at the same time the data is still usable for the natural language processing tasks for which it was collected and for other types of research.

We cordially invite all those interested in all aspects of pseudonymization and privacy protection of the research data to attend the Open House event organized by the team behind the project Mormor Karl 


During the workshop day, a number of invited speakers from Sweden, Scandinavia and elsewhere will present their research on data pseudonymization and privacy preservation; Grandma Karl researchers will showcase research problems they will be working with in the next five years, and a panel discussion will involve panelists and audience in a timely discussion on pseudonymization and open access to research data.
